<h1>Interaction Design Documentation</h1>
<p><img src="./iad_exercise_3/iad-exercise_3-12.jpeg" alt="header image"></p>
<p>This is a documentation of the exercises I did for the course 'Interaction Design' at university. Students were tasked to experiment with different inputs and outputs in order to learn about the nature of designing interactive experiences.</p>
<p>The documentation aims to explain the different iterations each artifact went through. In order to keep things interesting to read through, I decided to deliver the documentation as a website thus giving me the possibility to design even more interactions - at least theoretically. In practice, I don't have much experience with building websites let alone setting up a single-page-application (SPA) this tries to be. Therefore, the delivery in itself was also a learning experience and the code behind some interactions and effects is heavily inspired by others, that I tried to (give) credit as much as possible.</p>
<p>As for my learning of Vue.js - the framework behind the SPA - credits go to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GNsWa_EZdw">this</a> tutorial.</p>
